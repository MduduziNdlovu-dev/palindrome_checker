# Palindrome Checker

This project is a simple Palindrome Checker built as part of a certification project from Udemy. The goal of this project was to apply fundamental web development concepts in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional and user-friendly tool.

## Overview

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). The Palindrome Checker allows users to input text, and it checks whether the text is a palindrome.

### Key Features:
- **Input validation**: The app prompts users to input a valid text string.
- **Palindrome check**: The app checks if the inputted string is a palindrome.
- **User interface**: A clean, interactive interface that shows the result when the user submits the text.
- **Responsive design**: The app works well on various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the web page and form elements.
- **CSS3**: For styling the page and adding modern design features.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the logic behind palindrome checking and form submission.
- **Flexbox**: For creating a flexible layout for the form and the result display.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to launch the application.
3. Enter the text you want to check for a palindrome in the input field.
4. Click the "Check!!" button to see if the text is a palindrome.
5. The result will be displayed below the form.

## Project Structure
